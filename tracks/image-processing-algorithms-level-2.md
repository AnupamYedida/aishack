excerpt: "Learn how commonly used algorithms in computer vision work under the hood. You'll learn a wide variety of techniques to add to your arsenal."

Level 2 of the `Image Processing Algorithms` track takes you through a few more techniques commonly used in computer vision. These algorithms often form the basis for higher level algorithms that do much more sophisticated tasks.

I recommend you complete [level 1](/tracks/image-processing-algorithms-level1) of this track series!
